check_other
===========

This plugin is designed to execute another plugin that is given as an argument.

Usually you want this to use the perfdata parsing of pynag and you want to alert on specific thresholds in the other plugin.

Usage:
```
check_other -- check_nrpe -H localhost -c check_load

# Same as above, but alert on performance metric load1
check_other --threshold metric=load1,warn=2..inf -- check_nrpe -H localhost -c check_load
```
